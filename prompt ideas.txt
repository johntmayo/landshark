❯ Dude you did amazing this is so fucking cool. COuple Qs: I didn't understand how it worked at first but once I
  discovered the season slider I think it's genius. It's so cool. I'm like, I kind of want to make a new different
  version where you can select a season and see the whole cast but I don't want to go there yet because I think
  that you've come at it from this other angle that's more interesting. It'll highlight people who weren't
  necessarily, I don't know, see who was together and who left. It's very cool.

  I also like that you can click somebody's name and then see their cast mates. I think that's brilliant. That said
   the season slider is a little too small and the design is a little faint so I can't quite even see that it's
  inviting me to select a season. I think that it should be moved over. Well I don't know, I'm inclined to keep it
  where it is and make it a little bigger, like horizontally, a little bit bigger so it's a little easier to pick a
   season. I'm finding myself wanting the ability to sort names alphabetically. Your inclusion of errors is
  brilliant you
